Startup Designing

Journey from 0-1. (Ideation Phase)

User - Value proposition (Unique is second step) 

USP (Unique Selling Proposition) - Can be many things.
- You have some thing different (say gov contacts), but it might not add value-  

1. Customer Acquisition Cost
2. Retaining User (20-40%) atleast
3. Engagement.

Journey ahead will be after ideation.
