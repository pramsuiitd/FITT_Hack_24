1. Man in the Middle Attack
2. DDoS Attack
3. Spoofing Attack
4. Unauthorized Access
5. Priviledge Escalation
6. Code/Packet Injection Attacks
7. Insider Threats (User/Packet Analysis using ML Models)

Our aim is to make a program which can accurately detect such things.

We can consider detecting packets at edge, as transfering it to the nodes might be time consuming and bandwidth intensive.

Provenance graphs can be used for detection of some of this. Others can be detected using packet analysis at edge.

Say a particular node is said to be defective by a edge. They sent the data to the primary command center. 
This node can be malicious as well. How can we also protect against such. Probing? Asking for authorisations?


Things which we can include

1. Man in the Middle Attack (At the over-view after the coherance time)
2. DDoS Attack (Use ML to detect at the command center). The nodes don't matter, too many resources, not viable.
3. Spoofing. This can be kind-off detected using the Man in the Middle, protocol.
4. Unauthorized Access. Can be detected using similar style as Spoofing/Man in the Middle.

We have 3 deterministic and 1  undeterministic algorithm.
We can have a display which can showcase this in the Command Center. We can have protcols, these can be directly integrated in the market

Packet Structure Under Consideration:
- src_id
- dest_id
- packet_no
