1. Man in the Middle Attack
2. DDoS Attack
3. Spoofing Attack
4. Unauthorized Access
5. Priviledge Escalation
6. Code/Packet Injection Attacks
7. Insider Threats (User/Packet Analysis using ML Models)

Our aim is to make a program which can accurately detect such things.

We can consider detecting packets at edge, as transfering it to the nodes might be time consuming and bandwidth intensive.

Provenance graphs can be used for detection of some of this. Others can be detected using packet analysis at edge.

Say a particular node is said to be defective by a edge. They sent the data to the primary command center. 
This node can be malicious as well. How can we also protect against such. Probing? Asking for authorisations?
